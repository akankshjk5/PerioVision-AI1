# PerioVision AI: Security Control Matrix

One row per control. Every row names where it lives and what demonstrates it. A control
with no evidence column entry does not belong in this file.

Status values: **Implemented** (in code, tested) · **Partial** (works, with a stated limit)
· **Operational** (a deployment or repository setting, not code).

## Deliberately not implemented

| Rejected | Why |
|---|---|
| CSRF tokens | Bearer header plus a SameSite=Strict cookie scoped to `/api/auth` |
| Bandit, Semgrep | Python coverage overlaps CodeQL; three SAST tools add noise, not coverage |
| A second rate limiter for authorization failures | Duplicates the existing limiter; detection is the right layer |
| Encrypting the audit log | Breaks verification, and it holds no PHI |
| Field encryption on bone-loss values | Must stay queryable; pseudonymisation suffices |
| A full SIEM | Disproportionate; a clean event taxonomy a SIEM can consume is the right scope |
