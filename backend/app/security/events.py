"""Security event taxonomy and detection over the audit log.

The audit log already records who did what, when, to which resource and with what
result. What it could not do was answer "is something wrong right now?": a single
refused request is routine, while thirty in a minute from one account is someone
working through patient identifiers.

Two pieces, both deliberately small:

  TAXONOMY   every event name the application records, mapped to a category and a
             severity. Nothing is recorded uncategorised: a test asserts that every
             action name in the codebase appears here, so a new event has to be
             classified when it is added rather than quietly joining a pile of
             unlabelled strings.

  RULES      windowed thresholds over those events. A rule counts matching entries
             inside a time window, grouped by actor, and raises an alert when the
             count reaches its threshold.

This reads the existing audit log rather than introducing a second store, which
means detection inherits the log's tamper-evidence: an attacker who wants to hide
a burst of failures has to defeat the hash chain to do it. There is no daemon and
no new persistence - alerts are computed on demand from entries already written.
It is intentionally not a SIEM; it is a clean set of signals a SIEM could consume.

Alerts carry actor IDs, counts and event names. They never carry PHI, because the
events themselves do not: patient resources are recorded as pseudonyms.
