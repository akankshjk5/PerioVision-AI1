"""Clinical approval of a model, signed by a key the model builder does not hold.

The approval gate used to read `approval_status` out of the manifest. That manifest is
signed by the build key, so whoever could sign a model could also mark it approved:
approval recorded who built the model, not who cleared it for use on patients.

Approval is now a separate artifact under a separate key:

    weights/approvals.json       the record: which model, which version, which hash
    weights/approvals.json.sig   RSA-PSS over that record, by keys/model_approval.pem

An approval names the model's **exact SHA-256**, so it covers specific bytes and nothing
else. Rebuilding a model - even to the same version number - produces a different hash and
the old approval no longer applies. Neither key is sufficient alone:

    build key only     can ship bytes, cannot clear them for clinical use
    approval key only  can clear a hash, cannot produce bytes that match one

Both keys in one pair of hands defeats this, as it would any separation of duties. What it
buys is that the split is now expressible and enforced, rather than impossible.
